## Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced the so-called “maximum bidding” Introduced a new bid type “average bidding” as an alternative to the bid type. One of our customers, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if average bidding brings more conversions than maximumbidding. A/B testing has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com now expects you to analyze the results of this A/B test.
